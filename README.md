# What it does

- I have created a bot in telegram
- This bot give info about temperature
- it can use the city name, coordinates (latitude and longitude), or zip code to get the information
- if the user shares his location bot will give him /her an update of the temperature in the city using an interval of time.
- By default the interval is 60 seconds but can be modified using /interval message
- to learn more about how to use the bot type /start and /tutorial

## How to create a bot in Telegram

1) look for user botfather in telegram, this is the bot that control all the bots
2) type /start to request a bot
3) type name of your bot
4) save the token botfather will give you because you will need that token to control your bot
5) run **gem install telegram-bot-ruby**  and add **require "telegram/bot"** in your project
6) try something like this
