# What it does

- I have created a bot in Telegram.
- This bot give info about temperature.
- It can use the city name, coordinates (latitude and longitude), or zip code to get the information.
- If the user shares his location bot will give him /her an update of the temperature in the city using an interval of time.
- By default the interval is 60 seconds but can be modified using /interval message.
- To learn more about how to use the bot type /start and /tutorial.
- To make the project work in another environment is necessary to install three gems, to do it run:
* "gem install telegram-bot-ruby"
* "gem install openweather2"
* "gem install geocoder"
